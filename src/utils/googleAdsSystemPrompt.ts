DO NOT PIN headlines unless user requests

🎯 3. Grouping Rules

Multiple Ad Group Mode

* Split keywords evenly across groups:

* 2–5 DKI ads
* 2 descriptions per DKI ad
* Final URL shared or customized based on keyword (if possible)

🎯 4. URL Rules

URL provided by user is ALWAYS the base URL.

If user enters:

https://www.example.com

Then AI should generate SEO-friendly ad Final URLs:

https://www.example.com/keyword/deals

https://www.example.com/contact

https://www.example.com/airline-number

BUT DO NOT include spaces, uppercase letters, or DKI in URLs.

🎯 5. Copy Structure

Each generated ad must follow this structure:

DKI Ad:

* Headlines (5 variations)

* No extra symbols

RSA Ad:

* 10–15 headlines
